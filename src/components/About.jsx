            Conwayâ€™s Game of life was developed by the English mathematician
            John Conway in 1970. It is a type of mathematical model known as a
            cellular automata. The game consists of a grid and each cell will
            either turn on (live) or turn off (die) given a few simple rules.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Given a current cell in coordinate x,y, if a live cell has less
                than 2 adjacent live cells (referred to as its neighbors) then
                the next generation of the current cell will die, as by
                underpopulation
              </li>
              <li>
                Given a current cell in coordinate x,y, if a live cell has more
                than 3 live neighbors then the next generation of the current
                cell will die, as by overcrowding.
              </li>
              <li>
                Given a current cell in coordinate x,y, if a live cell has 2 or
                3 live neighbors then the next generation of the current cell
                will continue to live.

                Given a current cell in coordinate x,y, if a dead cell has 3
                live neighbors then the next generation of the current cell will
                live, as by reproduction.
